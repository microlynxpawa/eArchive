Performance/Best Practice Issues in Your Node.js/Express App
===============================================================

1. Synchronous File System Operations
   - Using fs.copyFileSync, fs.mkdirSync, etc. in services blocks the Node.js event loop and slows down all requests.
   - Solution: Use asynchronous versions (fs.promises.copyFile, fs.promises.mkdir, etc.).

2. Heavy or Repeated Database Queries
   - Many controllers use .findOne/.findAll with includes for related models, which can be slow if the DB is large or underpowered.
   - Solution: Only select needed fields (attributes), avoid unnecessary includes, and add indexes to frequently queried columns.

3. Large Data Loads
   - Rendering or sending large file structures (e.g., in seeFile) can be slow if the directory is large or deeply nested.
   - Solution: Paginate or lazy-load file/folder trees.

4. In-Memory Session Storage
   - Using express-session with no store option means all sessions are kept in memory, which can grow and is lost on server restart.
   - Solution: Use a session store like Redis or a database for better scalability and reliability.

5. Static File Serving
   - Serving static files (especially large or many files) directly from Node.js can slow down the server.
   - Solution: Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx) or a dedicated file server for static files.

6. Heavy Middleware on Every Request
   - Middlewares like authUser, getUserPermissions, and passAuths run on every request and may do DB lookups each time.
   - Solution: Cache user permissions in the session if they don’t change often, and only run heavy middleware where needed.

7. Error Handling
   - Some controllers catch errors and log them but may not always send a response quickly, which can hang requests.
   - Solution: Always send a response on error to avoid hanging requests.

8. Cron Jobs
   - The daily cleanup job could slow down the server if it is heavy and runs in the same process.
   - Solution: Make sure it runs quickly or offload it to a separate process if needed.

UI/Client-Side Issues
=====================

1. Large/Unoptimized AJAX and Fetch Requests
   - Fetching large datasets (e.g., all files, all users) at once can overload the server and slow down the UI.
   - Solution: Paginate or lazy-load large lists. Only fetch what is needed for the current view.

2. Multiple/Redundant Requests
   - Triggering multiple requests in quick succession (e.g., on every keystroke) can overwhelm the server.
   - Solution: Debounce search inputs and batch requests where possible.

3. Heavy Client-Side Rendering
   - Rendering large lists or trees in the browser can cause slow page loads and high memory usage.
   - Solution: Render only visible items, or use virtual scrolling for large lists.

4. Synchronous UI Blocking
   - Synchronous loops or blocking code in the browser can freeze the UI.
   - Solution: Break up large tasks, use async patterns, and avoid blocking the main thread.

5. Reloading the Entire Page
   - Using window.location.reload() after actions can be slow if the page is heavy or the server is slow.
   - Solution: Update the UI dynamically (AJAX/DOM updates) instead of full reloads where possible.

6. Loading Many Scripts/Assets
   - Loading many JS libraries and assets on every page adds to load time.
   - Solution: Load only the scripts needed for each page, or use code splitting.

7. No Client-Side Caching
   - Fetching the same data repeatedly without caching increases server load.
   - Solution: Cache frequently used data in the browser (localStorage, sessionStorage, or in-memory).

8. No Error Handling for Slow/Failed Requests
   - Not handling slow or failed responses can lead to a poor user experience.
   - Solution: Show loading indicators and handle errors with user-friendly messages.

Security Best Practices
======================

1. Input Validation & Sanitization
   - Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
   - Use libraries like express-validator or joi.

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - Protect all sensitive routes with authentication middleware.
   - Check user permissions on every action.

3. Session Security
   - Use a strong, unpredictable session secret.
   - Set cookie.secure: true in production (requires HTTPS).
   - Set httpOnly: true and sameSite: 'lax' or 'strict' for cookies.
   - Use a persistent session store for production.

4. HTTPS Everywhere
   - Always serve your app over HTTPS in production.

5. CSRF Protection
   - Use CSRF tokens for forms and state-changing requests.

6. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
   - Limit the number of requests per IP/user.

7. Secure HTTP Headers
   - Use the helmet middleware to set secure HTTP headers.

8. File Upload Security
   - Validate file types and sizes. Store uploaded files outside the web root.

9. Error Handling
   - Never expose stack traces or sensitive error details to the client.

10. Dependency Management
    - Keep all dependencies up to date. Run npm audit regularly.

11. Prevent NoSQL/SQL Injection
    - Use parameterized queries or ORM methods.

12. CORS Configuration
    - Set CORS policy to only allow trusted origins.

13. Logging & Monitoring
    - Log authentication attempts, errors, and suspicious activity.

14. Limit Data Exposure
    - Only return necessary fields in API responses.

Server Setup & Windows Server 2019 Tips
=======================================

1. Keep Windows Updated
   - Ensure all Windows updates and security patches are installed.

2. Disable Unnecessary Services
   - Turn off Windows services and background apps you don’t need.

3. Optimize Power Settings
   - Set the server to “High Performance” mode in Power Options.

4. Use a Reverse Proxy
   - Use IIS, Nginx, or Apache as a reverse proxy in front of Node.js.

5. Increase System Resources
   - Add more RAM and use SSD storage if possible.

6. Monitor Resource Usage
   - Use Task Manager, Resource Monitor, or third-party tools to watch CPU, RAM, and disk usage.

7. Optimize Node.js Process
   - Use Node.js LTS version. Use a process manager like PM2. Use clustering if you have multiple CPU cores.

8. Network Configuration
   - Ensure the server is on a wired, stable network.

9. Antivirus/Firewall
   - Exclude your app’s folders from real-time antivirus scanning. Make sure firewall rules allow necessary traffic.

10. Scheduled Tasks & Backups
    - Schedule heavy tasks (backups, virus scans, Windows updates) during off-peak hours.

11. Disk Cleanup
    - Regularly clean up temp files, logs, and unused files.

12. Virtualization
    - If running in a VM, ensure it has enough dedicated resources.

13. Server Roles
    - Don’t run unnecessary server roles on the same machine as your app.

14. Logging
    - Store logs on a separate disk if possible, or rotate logs to prevent disk fill-up.
